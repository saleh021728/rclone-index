# rclone-index
Deploy rclone index for your cloud storages easily

Keep in mind that there are already some other rclone index repositories out there that you can deploy for yourself, this repository is mainly my own approach for that purpose. To name a few of those repositories: (these repositories may be old, but they should still work)

1. https://github.com/developeranaz/RCLONE-SERVE-INDEX
2. https://github.com/culturecloud/rclone-index
3. https://github.com/iamdjsai9999/Multi-Cloud-Index

## Demo Site
https://rclone-index.glitch.me/

## Environment variables
1. `CONFIG_URL`

Raw rclone config URL. You can use https://gist.github.com, create a secret gist, paste your rclone.conf content, save it, and copy the raw URL of that gist.

2. `PORT` (Optional)

Server port you want to use for rclone index. If you use PaaS, it's most likely that PORT variable has been assigned by default, so you can leave this blank first to check. If you don't specify and the server you use doesn't assign PORT variable automatically, it will use 8080 port.

3. `USERNAME` (Optional)

Username for authentication (leave blank for no auth). It must be paired with `PASSWORD` variable if you want to add authentication.

4. `PASSWORD` (Optional)

Password for authentication (leave blank for no auth). It must be paired with `USERNAME` variable if you want to add authentication.
